Welcome to The Data Playground!

This is a space to experiment with new ways to engage users with the Ransom Center collections using a data-driven approach. The Data Playground is in a permanent beta status. Each one of the case studies portraits a proof of concept for a new way to expoit the Center's metadata.

Check out the [Case Studies](caseStudies.md) and learn more about the [projects that inspire us](inspiration.md).
